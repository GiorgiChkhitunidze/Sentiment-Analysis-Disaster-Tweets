# Sentiment Analysis using Kaggle Disaster Tweets dataset

<p> This repository is devoted to my first sentiment analysis project using BERT model as a text encoder.</p>
<p><b>Have to share trained model weights file through Dropbox as its size is more than 1 GB: <i>https://www.dropbox.com/s/xwzg1qxkxz0rz3c/model_20.pt?dl=0</i></b></p>

##### The notebook consists of:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing data
- Setting up Dataset and DataLoader (which also tokenizes text with bert tokenizer)
- Building neural model and training
- Final Prediction and Visualization of results
